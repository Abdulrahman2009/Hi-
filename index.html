                Nearly everything we eat comes from plants, animals, birds, fish and other sea creatures like shellfish. We can eat the edible parts of many plants like roots and leaves as well as things plants produce like fruits and seeds. We can also eat various parts of animals as well as things animals produce like milk. In many parts of the world people also eat insects and things they produce like honey.

                Before the development of agriculture, people got food from the plants and animals in the world around them. They dug up roots, gathered fruits and seeds, hunted and trapped animals and birds and used spears and nets to catch fish. They also collected shellfish and other seafood as well as insects and bird eggs, and in many parts of the world people still do all these things.
